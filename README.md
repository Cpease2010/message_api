# Message_API
This simple API will enables real-time communication between 2 or more clients on separate networks. While a client is included in the this repo, it is for testing purposes.

## Quick Start
1. Clone with repo to your environment.
1. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal
1. Run `npm i` to install dependencies
1. Run `node server.js` to start the server
1. Run `npm lite-server` to start the client

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Socket.io
- PostgreSQL

## Assumptions
- The tech stack was chosen based on techs already in use.
- Websockets were implemented over REST to allow for free flowing communication between the server and clients.
- Frontend design was not important as the requirements only spoke of the backend.
